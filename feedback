      <p class="lead">
        They say feedback is the breakfast of champions. But there is a quieter truth we
        learn only through experience: not every opinion deserves a seat at your table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in my postgraduate training, I encountered a moment that could easily have
        rewritten my self-belief. A professor, standing before a class of accomplished
        professionals—first-class graduates, senior registrars, lecturers—dismissed our
        intellectual capacity with words that cut deep. In his judgment, we were unworthy
        of the degree we were pursuing. At one point, he even suggested that failure would
        be our collective destiny.
      </p>

      <p class="pull">
        It was a defining crossroads—not because of what was said, but because of how we
        chose to respond.
      </p>

      <p>
        I happened to serve as the class representative, a role I later elevated—perhaps
        audaciously—into what I called “Class Governor.” After those tense sessions, I
        would stand before my peers and remind them of a truth louder than any criticism:
        we were not accidental occupants of that room. We had earned our place. I
        understood, even then, that the real battle was not academic; it was a battle of
        mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I made a quiet decision. I refused to internalize the labels. I trained my mind
        to believe in something radical at the time: <em>I am capable. I am intelligent.
        I am not defined by this moment.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        What followed was collective resilience. We regrouped. We organized extra study
        sessions. We leaned into each other’s strengths. One among us grasped concepts with
        astonishing speed, often understanding ideas before they appeared on the
        syllabus. Another had an uncanny ability to trace hidden reference materials and
        academic sources that seemed deliberately out of reach. Together, we learned how
        to navigate systems that quietly capped excellence and rewarded conformity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Against expectations—and against prevailing opinions—our cohort became a
        breakthrough set. We produced an unprecedented number of PhD graduates and
        recorded the highest number of graduands in our program’s history. To my
        knowledge, that record still stands.
      </p>

      <p class="pull">
        Those early judgments were opinions. They were never our reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same lesson reappeared later in my career, this time in corporate corridors
        rather than lecture halls. There were hiring managers and supervisors whose words
        diminished confidence rather than developed it—moments where one interview or one
        interaction made you question your worth. But instead of surrendering to
        discouragement, we treated those experiences as data, not verdicts.
      </p>

      <p>
        We sharpened our skills. We doubled down on our strengths. We learned relentlessly.
        And in one of life’s quiet ironies, some of us would later find ourselves managing
        portfolios within the very organizations that once doubted our capacity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This reflection is not written to diminish professors, hiring managers, or
        supervisors. Many are excellent mentors who shape lives for the better. Rather, it
        is written for those coming behind—for the younger professionals who may be
        standing today where I once stood, wondering whether someone else’s judgment
        should define their future.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not yet where I aspire to be. But I am certain of one thing: I am on my way.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        The lessons, distilled through time, are simple and enduring:
      </p>

      <ul class="lessons">
        <li>You are not your label.</li>
        <li>Someone else’s opinion of you should never become your reality.</li>
        <li>Not being at your best today does not make you weak.</li>
        <li>Carry humility in victory and courage in setback.</li>
        <li>A fall is not permission to stay down.</li>
        <li>What matters most is the direction you are headed, not the obstacles along the road.</li>
        <li>Trying gives you a chance. Giving up guarantees defeat.</li>
        <li>Every piece of feedback—fair or unfair—can become a launchpad if you choose to use it wisely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="pull">
        Above all, remember this: your story is still being written.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Go and succeed.
